### Todo 20/10/2016

- [ ] How to add text in the first section (home page)
- [ ] The google maps doesn't appear (and I don't know how to set it up. There is no in the documentation)
- [ ] If you set the map as last section it doesn't work
- [ ] There is no info in the documentation on how to set a point on the map
- [ ] There is no way to set smaller italic title (like there are in the demo)
- [ ] There is no info about how to set the availability engine (I think that for a B&B this is the core)
- [ ] Availability engine section don't accept a background image
- [ ] Availability engine doesn't have a clean layout
- [ ] Please provide a more in-depth documentation and explain how to install, setup this theme and how it works, step by step, without relying on demo content. For example, how to setup the contact form if its using plugin, how to setup the inner pages, how to setup 3rd party plugin which is used in demo but required custom setup especially the styling etc etc.
- [ ] There are several reports of malfunction in this theme https://themeforest.net/item/bedbreakfast-single-page-wordpress-theme/6353778/comments
